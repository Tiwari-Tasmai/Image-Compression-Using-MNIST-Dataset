Image compression is one of the useful methods in a variety of multimedia services. In order to digitize the image, more bandwidth is required, which in turn raises data transmission costs. As a result, neural networks are utilized to maximize bandwidth usage. In addition, Deep Learning has recently advanced to the point where it can be used to compress images. Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) can be combined in any proportion to produce any color in the visible spectrum.

Up-sampling and down-sampling of an image are carried out with the assistance of the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset, and I propose a Convolutional Auto encoder neural network for the purpose of image compression. An RGB image is compressed into a noise-filled image that measures 28 by 28 pixels after being up- and down-sampled. After compression, the final image should still be 28 by 28 in size.

The primary objective is to compress an image without significantly affecting its quality.
